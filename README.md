# KalmanFilter
Mobile Robot Localization using Kalman Filter 

To run program:
python3 kalman.py

For parts A and B, run the code with <python3 kalman.py>
for part C, to change the covariance for all the data, comment out lines 55 and 60. Then uncomment lines 56 and 61. Run it <python3 kalman.py>
For part C, to change a range of the covariance, comment out lines 56 and 61. Uncomment lines 57, 58, 62, and 63. Run it <python3 kalman.py>
For part D, to change all the data points, comment out lines 45, 57, 58, 62, and 63. uncomment lines 47, 55, and 60.  Run it <python3 kalman.py>
for part D, to change a range of the covariance data points, comment out line 47 and uncomment lines 48 and 49.  Run it <python3 kalman.py>
For part E, to change covariance and add noise to all data points, comment out lines 48, 49, 55, and 60. Uncomment lines 45, 56, 61, 124, and 125.  Run it <python3 kalman.py>
For part E, to add only a range of altered data points, comment out lines 56 and 61. Uncomment lines 55, 57, 58, 60, 62, 63, 127, 128, 129, and 130.  Run it <python3 kalman.py>
